The program runs in C++ and asks users to input their account name, deposit, withdrawal, or balance. It stores a pointer that will store the user who has created the account. Depending on the option that the user pick, the program will run a certain task. For example, if the user types in 1, the program will allow the user to create their account. 

The program starts with a menu giving a selection of numbers (1-5). Depending on what the user selects, the program will run that task. Ideally, the user has to select 1 first before proceeding with the other tasks or else the program will run it as invalid.
